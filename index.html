                <p>The electrical conductivity of a material can be used to monitor changes in its microstructure 
                    during thermal treatment. This is measured using the four-point probe method, with a current 
                    source (Keithley 6220) providing a small current and a nanovoltmeter (Keithley 2182a) measuring 
                    the voltage. Resistance is calculated from these values and can be converted to conductivity if 
                    sample dimensions are known. Additionally, a multimeter (HP 3478a) can be used as a temperature 
                    sensor by connecting a thermocouple to it and converting the voltage output to degrees Celsius.
                    <br>The goal of this project is to develop a Windows-based app that can be used to measure 
                    conductivity. The app connects to the electrical instruments through a PCI-GPIB interface 
                    made by National Instruments.
                    <br>Highlight features of the app:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hand-Free Instrument Controls: The app automatically talks to the devices and lets users control the instruments from the app's interface instead of using the front panels.</li>
                    <li>Real-Time Monitoring: The GUI includes an interactive graph and table that display real-time measurements and calculations.</li>
                    <li>Remote Access & Control: Some experiments take days; a web app enables users to check on experiments and control current supply output.</li>
                    <li>Acquisition Rate: Users are able to control the acquisition rate of the nanovoltmeter directly from the app's interface.</li>
                    <li>Data Output: The app stores a comprehensive .CSV file of each experiment's data automatically.</li>
                </ul>

                    The app is based on the .NET framework using Microsoft Visual Studio. It is programmed in C# 
                    and supports Windows 10 and 11. Both the graphical and tabular outputs are displayed using 
                    SyncFusion libraries. The remote access feature is implemented as a web app through Netlify 
                    and Conveyor, and for security purposes, it requires an SSL certificate and a connection to 
                    McMaster's VPN. For instrument communications, National Instruments libraries and instrument-
                    specific SCPI commands are utilized.</p>
