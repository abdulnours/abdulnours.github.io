            <div class="project-details">
                <p>The electrical conductivity of a material can be used to monitor changes in its microstructure during thermal treatment. This is measured using the four-point probe method, with a current source (Keithley 6220) providing a small current and a nanovoltmeter (Keithley 2182a) measuring the voltage. Resistance is calculated from these values and can be converted to conductivity if sample dimensions are known. Additionally, a multimeter (HP 3478a) can be used as a temperature sensor by connecting a thermocouple to it and converting the voltage output to degrees Celsius.
                    <br>The goal of this project is to develop a Windows-based app that can be used to measure conductivity. The app connects to the electrical instruments through a PCI-GPIB interface made by National Instruments.
                    <br>Highlight features of the app:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hand-Free Instrument Controls: The app automatically talks to the devices and lets users control the instruments from the app's interface instead of using the front panels.</li>
                    <li>Real-Time Monitoring: The GUI includes an interactive graph and table that display real-time measurements and calculations.</li>
                    <li>Remote Access & Control: Some experiments take days; a web app enables users to check on experiments and control current supply output.</li>
                    <li>Acquisition Rate: Users are able to control the acquisition rate of the nanovoltmeter directly from the app's interface.</li>
                    <li>Data Output: The app stores a comprehensive .CSV file of each experiment's data automatically.</li>
                </ul>

                    The app is based on the .NET framework using Microsoft Visual Studio. It is programmed in C# and supports Windows 10 and 11. Both the graphical and tabular outputs are displayed using SyncFusion libraries. The remote access feature is implemented as a web app through Netlify and Conveyor, and for security purposes, it requires an SSL certificate and a connection to McMaster's VPN. For instrument communications, National Instruments libraries and instrument-specific SCPI commands are utilized.</p>
