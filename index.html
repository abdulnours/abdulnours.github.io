            <p>Capstone Project · McMaster University</p>
            <p>September 2022 - April 2023</p>
            <!-- Add job details here -->

            <p>• Designed and implemented a Windows app, programmed in C#, and using the .NET framework in MS Visual Studio as a team of 5.
                <br>• Troubleshooted the stakeholder's lab computer and rebuilt it with the necessary fixes and hardware replacements, performed a Windows upgrade, and facilitated network connection.
                <br>• Examined documentation of HW interface and electrical measurement instruments in order to operate and communicate with them.
                <br>• Documented the entire project with LaTeX in stages; requirements, design, and validation & verification. Presented to stakeholders.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The electrical conductivity of a material can be used to monitor changes in its microstructure during thermal treatment. This is measured using the four-point probe method, with a current source (Keithley 6220) providing a small current and a nanovoltmeter (Keithley 2182a) measuring the voltage. Resistance is calculated from these values and can be converted to conductivity if sample dimensions are known. Additionally, a multimeter (HP 3478a) can be used as a temperature sensor by connecting a thermocouple to it and converting the voltage output to degrees Celsius.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The goal of this project is to develop a Windows-based app that can be used to measure conductivity. The app connects to the electrical instruments through a PCI-GPIB interface made by National Instruments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Highlight features of the app:</p>

                <br>• Hand-Free Instrument Controls: The app automatically talks to the devices and lets users control the instruments from the app's interface instead of using the front panels.
                <br>• Real-Time Monitoring: The GUI includes an interactive graph and table that display real-time measurements and calculations.
                <br>• Remote Access & Control: Some experiments take days; a web app enables users to check on experiments and control current supply output.
                <br>• Acquisition Rate: Users are able to control the acquisition rate of the nanovoltmeter directly from the app's interface.
                <br>• Data Output: The app stores a comprehensive .CSV file of each experiment's data automatically.
            </p>

            <br>The app is based on the .NET framework using Microsoft Visual Studio. It is programmed in C# and supports Windows 10 and 11. Both the graphical and tabular outputs are displayed using SyncFusion libraries. The remote access feature is implemented as a web app through Netlify and Conveyor, and for security purposes, it requires an SSL certificate and a connection to McMaster's VPN. For instrument communications, National Instruments libraries and instrument-specific SCPI commands are utilized.</p>
